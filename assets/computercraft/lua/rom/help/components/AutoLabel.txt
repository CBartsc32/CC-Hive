This script is designed to be run on startup and checks if computers have a label.
If it does not then it makes one based on several pieces of data which can help identify the computer.
The format of the resulting lable is '<Advanced|Normal><Turtle|Pocket|Computer><ID>' all within 2 characters (plus id)
If the computer already has a label and you want this script to assign a new one then you can run the script with the argument f

valid arguments:
nil = automatic detect and generate if needed
f = force regenerate
h = print internal program help

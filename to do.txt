make code portable, autorun folder is rom only (everything in autorun needs to move to startup or some other root file or I need to make my own auto run)

add to do comments to scripts
turtle movement api - make it emit turtle_moved event
turtle task requesting script
task master
drone watcher
tracking script (turtle side)
remote connect - control computers like you are there, use Lyquds' nsh?
lua table for storing user settings
GUI

migrate help docs to CC default location so that they can be loaded by the help program provided by CC?, may have problems with the help docs being in rom
	backup option, have own help program


this system may become an OS, I have mixed feelings about that.

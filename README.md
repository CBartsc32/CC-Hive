Hive will be a mind, that can / will control all turtles it has power over to make them carry out jobs any user can assign. You can assign jobs to a turtle as well as get the status and how well the turtle is doing. As a backup if a turtle errors it will drop into a command access where a client can see a turtle has errored and access it's command line and attempt to fix it without having to go to the turtle. If it can't be fixed you can request the turtle comes back to the hub.

The license is included in LICENSE.md
this project makes extensive use of other peoples code, these have there own licenses. The license deepest in the folder tree is the one that is "active" I.E. if you want to know how a file is licensed, navigate to the file and keep going up directories until you find a file named LICENSE. That file is the license for all of the files within its sibling folders. If you find another going deeper down the file tree, then that 'new' license *overrides* the previous.

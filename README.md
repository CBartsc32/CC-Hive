Hive is/will be a turtle based automation system. The user can assign jobs to different turtle types, each job can consist of multiple tasks. When a turtle finishes one job, it will request another, if none are available then it will go home.

I need to make this better, could do with an actual script too.

You may have noticed that the github repo is in the form of a MC resource pack. This is to allow easy testing, just download to a minecraft resource folder.

Want to help? fork the project, make some edits, and make a pull request. If you consistently give me code that I like, I'll make you a contributor (no more requesting) (Note to self: add collaborators here: https://github.com/lupus590/Hive/settings/collaboration)

#####this is a to do list of what the new installer whill hopefully do

* combine installer with lancher?
* package like system (how is best to do this?)
  * turtles only need the turtle bit and the shared stuff
  * servers only need the server bit and the shared stuff
  * client only needs client and shared
* have an update option, only redownloads installed packages which have changed

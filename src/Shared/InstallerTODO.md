#####this is a to do list of what the new installer will hopefully do

* intergrated code minifier, reduces the size and readability of the code (we are encouraging people to use the github repo for editing anyway, and it will reduce any space problems people may encounter in future)
* combine installer with lancher?
* package like system (how is best to do this?)
  * turtles only need the turtle bit and the shared stuff
  * servers only need the server bit and the shared stuff
  * client only needs client and shared
* have an update option, only redownloads installed packages which have changed

#ideas that are on/beyond the boarder of this project go here, these are in no particular order and are extra bits for after the core functions are done

* have some parts of task paralleled, this will allow multiple turtles/computers to work together on one task
* sharing tasks via an online database From readme: "You can also use the online job store to access jobs that other users have uploaded and even make upload your own. (This is part of CCSystems)."
* get skyNav to work
* downloader (pulls files from this repo)
* standalone installer (use some kind of self extracting archive program)

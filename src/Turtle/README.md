Turtle:

This will use a customised rednet based connection to a server that will be a constant stream (even when doing tasks, using multishell).

The Turtle will get given a jobid and xyz on where to perform it.

The turtle will go to the place using GPS and carry out the job.

Overloading the turtle movement functions will be needed for lama to work with job programs (the turtle may not finish a job in the same place that it started)

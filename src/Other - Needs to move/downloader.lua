--this file will eventually be ported to pastebin
--its purpose is to download the github repo to the CC computer

--TODO: download files

--TODO: ask if hive should run on startup
--if the computer is a turtle then 5 seconds to auto yes (with option to say no), this is to allow for turtle factories
--if turle then this installer will ask for a default nest (hive server)


--could use grin-get or some other github downloaders from the fourms and add this as a wrapper

--add a self extractor for if this is downloaded to a floppy for use on a server without HTTP enabled?

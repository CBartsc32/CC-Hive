### TODO: everything below

### TODO: reformat forum post copy for markdown

* [x] Convert readme, to do list to markdown format

* [x] Update lama (last forum post said that it was buggy/not working in CC1.63)
* [ ] Combine lama with starNav

* [ ] Make code portable, autorun folder is rom only (everything in autorun needs to move to startup or some other root file or I need to make my own auto run)


* [ ] licence for below: https://github.com/LeGoldFish/Advance-Turtle-Operating-Environment/blob/master/LICENSE

* [ ] slot.fuel - an idea from https://github.com/LeGoldFish/Advance-Turtle-Operating-Environment/blob/master/autoprograms/refuel.lua
 
* [x] installer code - from https://github.com/LeGoldFish/Advance-Turtle-Operating-Environment/blob/master/installer

-snip code-


* [ ] add to do comments to scripts
* [ ] turtle movement api - make it emit turtle_moved event
* [ ] turtle task requesting script
* [ ] task master
* [ ] drone watcher
* [ ] tracking script (turtle side)
* [ ] remote connect - control computers like you are there, use Lyquds' nsh?
* [ ] lua table for storing user settings
* [ ] GUI
* [ ] migrate help docs to CC default location so that they can be loaded by the help program provided by CC?, may have problems with the help docs being in rom
* [ ] backup option, have own help program
* [ ] make wiki on github repo? add one on CC wiki?
* [ ] This system may become an ~~OS~~ _shell_, I have mixed feelings about that.

* [ ] multi-threading - http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/19908-run-code-in-background/ (note from KingofGamesYami: I really wouldn't follow that tutorial, I wrote it and its not very good)

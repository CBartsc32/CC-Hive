task creation as an API?

data needed:
	priority
	drone requirements (pickaxe/hoe/fuel level/ect.) --blank for none
	drone ID (if a specific drone needs to do this task put the ID here) --blank for any drone, can be array so that one of the drones will do it
	
tasks will be stored in a table (or if object orientated and object)
